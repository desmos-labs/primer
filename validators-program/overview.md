# Desmos Validator program
The time has come. We are now inviting validators to join our public testnets.

If you feel ready to take the challenge and help us making the Desmos chain safer and more distributed, read below to know how to do it.

:::warning Validator rewards
In order to get the validator program running longer and include a larger number of validators, we will periodically revisit the number of tokens that will be rewarded upon becoming a validator of our chains. 

Also, we will reward tokens based on the activity of validators: more blocks you precommit and more reward you will get, so make sure your validator node is always active to get the larger amount of tokens possible.
  
Currently the reward for becoming a validator is set to be **50 Desmos Tokens + periodic rewards based on the availability of the node** (see below). 
  
Please note that in order to prevent scams, you will receive the initial reward just after your validator has **successfully proposed a block**.  
::: 

## Procedure to become a validator
The procedure to become a validator is composed of two parts: 

1. First thing first, you are required to setup a full node of your server machine. To do so, please follow the ["_Setting up a node_" guide on the Desmos documentation website](https://docs.desmos.network/testnets/join-public.html#validators). 

2. Once you have properly set up a full node, you can upgrade its functionality making it a validator node. To read how to do this, please refer to the ["_Run a validator on Desmos_" guide on the Desmos documentation website](https://docs.desmos.network/validators/validator-setup.html). 

:::tip Testnet version and data   
Please note that new validators must rely on the latest testnet running. Such testnet's `genesis.json` file and seeds information can be found inside the [root directory of the testnet repo](https://github.com/desmos-labs/morpheus).

## Getting the initial reward 
After you've become a validator, to make sure you receive your reward please following this procedure: 

1. Create a fork of this repo inside your private GitHub profile.  
   If you do not know how to do it, follow the [GitHub fork guide](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).

2. Pull the fork locally:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-name>/primer.git ~/desmos-primer
   cd ~/desmos-primer
   ```
   
3. Make sure your fork is up to date with the Primer repository:  
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/desmos-labs/primer.git
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/master
   ```

4. Create a file named after your GitHub username containing the validator creation transaction hash:  
   ```bash
   echo "<tx-hash>" >> ./phases/phase-2/challenges/validators/<your-github-name>
   
   # Example
   # echo "BFA3D9E508F1978135CB99AD07B975AB475AF8DD796C22D1B0984863B0ADACA9" >> ./phases/phase-2/challenges/validators/RiccardoM
   ```

5. Commit the changes, push them to your forked repo and create a pull request. If you do not know to to create one, refer to the [GitHub Pull Requests guide](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

## About periodic rewards
In order to prevent an over-accumulation in the hands of few validators, during each Phase of the Primer program we will review the rules and quantity of the tokens that will be allocated to validators. 

The currently running Phase is **Phase 3** and we have decided to allow for a maximum of **250 Desmos Tokens** to be distributed to each validator, based on the **number of pre-commits** their node will sign. 

We plan to run this phase for 31 days. Considering an average block time of 5.70 seconds, this means that each validator should sign approximately 469,894 pre-commits during that period of time. To incentivize validators to run their node through the whole Phase 3, we have decided to adopt a logarithmic token distribution: 

| Pre-commits signed | Tokens rewarded | 
| :----------------: | :-------------: |
| 1 | 1 |
| 4 | 2 |
| 18 | 3 |
| 78 | 7 |
| 331 | 12 |
| 1,416 | 21 |
| 6,044 | 40 |
| 25,796 | 73 |
| 110,097 | 135 |
| 469,894 | 250 |
