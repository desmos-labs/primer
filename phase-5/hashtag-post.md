With version `v0.6.0` we've implemented the ability for users to create posts containing hashtags. 

## Create your first hashtag post
Creating a post with a hashtag is immediate: simply create a post and include one or more hashtag(s) inside the message field. All you need to specify is the `subspace` of the post. If you do not know what a subspace here, please read the [related docs](http://docs.desmos.network/types/post.html#subspace). 

The command will then look like this: 

```bash
desmoscli tx posts create "<Subspace>" "<Message with hashtags>" \
  --from <your-key-name> --yes 
```

Here's an example of such command: 

```bash
desmoscli tx posts create \
  4e188d9c17150037d5199bbdb91ae1eb2a78a15aca04cb35530cccb81494b36e \
  "Hi! This is a post containing an #hashtag!" \
  --from jack --yes
```

Once you've run that command you will be asked to type the password you've chosen during the setup and after having inserted it properly you should see something like this: 

```yml
height: 0
txhash: E4920B61BFCFB935124FFC22BC04C1D5619943B138C87913E6EBCF2B5E892290
codespace: ""
code: 0
data: ""
rawlog: '[]'
logs: []
info: ""
gaswanted: 0
gasused: 0
tx: null
timestamp: ""
```

To make sure the transaction has been processed successfully, you can query it using the following command: 

```bash
desmoscli query tx <hash> --output json

# Example
# desmoscli query tx C43F94C2CF53473BD50F5B525CEABB4A3A20B7427E63207DDAF253A951444EFB --output json
``` 

This will return you the JSON representation of the transaction itself.

## Getting the reward 
After you've created the post, to make sure you receive your reward please follow this procedure: 

1. Create a fork of this repo inside your private GitHub profile.  
   If you do not know how to do it, follow the [GitHub fork guide](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).

2. Pull the fork locally:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-name>/primer.git ~/desmos-primer
   cd ~/desmos-primer
   ```
   
3. Make sure your fork is up to date with the Primer repository:  
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/desmos-labs/primer.git
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/master
   ```

4. Create a file named after your GitHub username containing the post creation transaction hash:  
   ```bash
   echo "<tx-hash>" >> ./phase-5/submissions/hashtags/<your-github-name>
   
   # Example
   # echo "E4920B61BFCFB935124FFC22BC04C1D5619943B138C87913E6EBCF2B5E892290" >> ./phase-5/submissions/hashtags/RiccardoM
   ```

5. Commit the changes, push them to your forked repo and create a pull request. If you do not know how to create one, refer to the [GitHub Pull Requests guide](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
