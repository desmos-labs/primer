# Phase 5
:::tip Phase 5 starting soon  
The current Morpheus status is planned to be exported at height `XXXXX`, which we estimate to be around XX June 2020 XX:XX UTC. 

However, to allow all validators to have a change or earning all the tokens by completing the [node updating challenge](update-node.md), we will start counting the precommits from the first block generated after XX June 2020 00:00 UTC.

Thanks to the latest Morpheus testnet (`morpheus-5000`), we've implemented the possibility for users of doing two new things: 

1. tagging a person inside a post with a multimedia file; 
2. reporting a post.

Inside Phase 5 you will be able to play with those features and earn some DSM by completing the following challenges:

- [Tag a person inside a post (50 Desmos Tokens)](tag-person.md)
- [Report a post (25 Desmos Tokens)](report-post.md)

Also, if you're a Desmos validator, you can earn other Desmos Tokens by completing the following challenge as well:
- [Undergo an update procedure (50 Desmos Tokens + Periodic rewards)](update-node.md)
