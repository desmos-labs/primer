Thanks to the latest Morpheus testnet (`morpheus-7001`), we've implemented the possibility for users of doing three new things: 

1. creating posts containing hashtags;
2. tagging a person inside a post with a media file; 
3. reporting a post.

Inside Phase 5 you will be able to play with those features and earn some DSM by completing the following challenges:

- [Create a post with an hashtag (25 Desmos Tokens)](hashtag-post.md)
- [Tag a person inside a post (50 Desmos Tokens)](tag-person.md)
- [Report a post (25 Desmos Tokens)](report-post.md)
- [Created or edit your profile (50 Desmos Tokens)](create-update-profile.md)

Also, if you're a Desmos validator, you can earn other Desmos Tokens by completing the following challenge as well:
- [Undergo an update procedure (50 Desmos Tokens + max. 6000 Desmos Tokens Periodic Uptime Rewards)](update-node.md)
