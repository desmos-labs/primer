## Introduction
This summer will surely be different for everyone due to the COVID-19. Most of us will not be able to travel where they planned, and some others will not even be able to enjoy a proper time off. 

In order to make things better, we at Desmos have thought about a new validators incentivization program: **Desmos Validating Summer**. This program will run starting from **August 16th 2020 at 00:00 UTC**. 

We have not yet decided a specific date in which it will end, but **it will last at most 1 month**. 

### Rewards 
During this period, validators who validate **more than 80%** of the blocks that will be produced will earn up to **6,000 DSM**.

One thing should be noted is that if you are planning to run a validator node: you need to make sure you are available if any update is required at any time. We might require you to perform an update procedure, and any failure in getting your node running again later will result in you loosing blocks and thus possible rewards.  

All the rewards will be distributed **once all will end**, and they will be visible inside our [Scoreboard](https://scoreboard.desmos.network). 

**Note**  
You should be a verified validator in order to be eligible to get the proper rewards. If you already completed one _Update your node_ challenge in previous Demos Primer phases, then you are good to go. If not, then you can contact us directly using our [Discord](https://discord.gg/yxPRGdq) 

## What happens after? 
After the Desmos Validating Summer is complete, the _Desmos Primer_ and the _Desmos Validators Program_ will resume as always, and you will have other chances of earning more DSM either by completing challenges or validating the chain.
