# Phase 6
Thanks to the latest Desmos version (`v0.12.3`), we've implemented the possibility for users of doing some new things: 

1. editing polls and attachments of a post;
2. adding a relationship towards users; 
3. blocking and unblocking users;
4. changing your DTag;
5. transferring your DTag to another user. 

Inside Phase 6 you will be able to play with those features and earn some DSM by completing the following challenges:

- [Create and edit a post changing its poll data and attachments (50 Desmos Tokens)](edit-post.md)
- [Add a relationship towards a user (25 Desmos Tokens)](create-relationship.md)
- [Block and unblock a user (50 Desmos Tokens)](block-unblock.md)
- [Change your DTag (25 Desmos Tokens)](change-dtag.md)
- [Transfer your DTag to another user (100 Desmos Tokens)](transfer-dtag.md)

:::warning Used version  
All these challenges must be completed using the latest Desmos version (`v0.12.3`). You can get it by cloning the Desmos repository and checking out that tag: 

```shell
git fetch -a 
git checkout tags/v0.12.3
make install
```
