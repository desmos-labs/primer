# Precommits data
During Phase 4, two chains (namely `morpheus-4000` and `morpheus-4001` were run). Here are the considered number of blocks for each chain: 

- `morpheus-4000` latest block considered: 380,000 (export height)
- `morpheus-4001` latest block considered: 183,623 (31 May 2020, 11:59:57)

This sums up to a total of `563,623` blocks. 

Since there was an update in between, as we state in [our Tweet](https://twitter.com/DesmosNetwork/status/1263052394134491142), we are considering the downtime while computing the amount of blocks that should be precommitted to get the maximum reward. 

For this reason we have decided to lower the required amount of precommitted blocks by `17,280`. This is the number of blocks that are produced in 24 hours considering 5 seconds per block. 

Tat being said, the Phase 4 rewards will be:
