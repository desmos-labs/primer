# Phase 4
:::tip Phase 4 starting soon  
The current Morpheus status is planned to be exported at height `820,300`, which we estimate to be around 24 April 2020 03:00 UTC. 

However, to allow all validators to have a change or earning all the tokens by completing the [node updating challenge](update-node.md), we will start counting the precommits from the first block generated after 27 April 2020 05:00 UTC.

Thanks to the latest Morpheus testnet (`morpheus-4000`), we've implemented the possibility for users of doing two new things: 

1. registering custom reactions that will later be possible to add to existing posts; 
2. creating personal profiles.  

Inside Phase 4 you will be able to play with those features and earn some DSM by completing the following challenges:

- [Register a reaction (50 Desmos Tokens)](register-reaction.md)
- [Create your account (50 Desmos Tokens)](create-account.md)

Also, if you're a Desmos validator, you can earn other Desmos Tokens by completing the following challenge as well:
- [Undergo an update procedure (50 Desmos Tokens + Periodic rewards)](update-node.md)
