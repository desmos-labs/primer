# Phase 3
The Phase 3 of the Primer program is based on the `morpheus-3000` testnet. In this phase you will learn how to post multimedia files or polls and how you can answer the latter.

If you are a validator you will also learn how you can undergo an update procedure so that your node can keep operating on the new chain version. 

## Challenges
Phase 3 challenges include: 

- [Creating a poll (100 Desmos Tokens)](create-poll.md)
- [Answering to an existent poll (10 Desmos Tokens)](answer-poll.md)
- [Creating a post containing a multimedia file (50 Desmos Tokens)](create-multimedia-post.md)
- [Undergo an update procedure (50 Desmos Tokens + Periodic rewards)](update-node.md)
