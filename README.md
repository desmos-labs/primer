# Desmos Primer Program

## Introduction
Community participation is crucial to the success of a new project. This is why we are launching *Desmos Primer* ("*Primer*"), a simple cookbook that will help you to get started with Desmos and enjoy a brand new social networking experience. 

## How the Primer works
To make things as easy as possible we will gradually publish new challenges that, once completed, will grant you `Desmos Points`. To help newer users to get used to the blockchain space, along with each challenge we will publish a step-by-step completion guide to explain the reason behind some specific operations. 

Once the primer has finished, no new challenges will be published and all your earned Desmos Points will be converted into `Desmos Token` ("`DT`"), the native staking token of the Desmos Chain, based on a conversion scale that we will publish very soon. 

You can complete the challenges in any order you prefer, but please note that you will only get Desmos Points when you have completed the challenges by the given deadlines.

In case of dispute, Desmos’ team reserves the right of the final decision.
